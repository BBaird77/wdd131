                <p>Kairos is an old world. It has seen millennia pass by since the age where the gods walked amongst us, their creations. I am one of the first, the eternal record keeper. I have chronicled all that has occurred and am now sharing it with the world. I hope that this information will help you to understand the struggles of this world, and perhaps, its outcome can be guided to a better path. I wish you the best of fortune.</p>

                <h2>The World of Kairos</h2>
                <p>A world ruled over by gods that forged each and every thing within it, from the smallest plant to the largest mountain. They once walked among us, in the land now known as Ultima Terra, although in that age it held a different name. The gods warred, and as they battled, the very land crumbled beneath their wrath. In the aftermath, most humans left the ruined continent and moved to new lands, each ruled by a sect of gods. The gods agreed to the Codex, a complex rule of laws designed to ensure that this disaster never occurred again.</p>
